# MrsRvr Front-End

Description
------------
The MrsRvs project is a space exploration inspired web app that implements data from NASA to give the user an out of this world expereince

It should be used for people who want to dive deeper into exploring what the surface looks like on other planets. There is also a chart that outlines the weather patterns on mars.

The MrsRvr site solves the problem of citizens lacking the knowlege to know whats going beyond earth and is giving them a user-friendly, bite-sized way to gain knowlege about space.


Brief Example
------------
This could be a code snippet showing how your project should be used (if it is meant to be integrated into another app)
This could be a screenshot of your project running in the browser (if it is a stand-alone application)


List of Features / User Stories
-------------------------------
Our Features Include:

   - Home Page - This is the first page that opens up once you go to the site and it displays different pictures that was taken by NASA's land rovers and their satellites. It displays the surfaces of planets but also, images of star systems and galexies. We have a Navigation bar that directs you to our Create Page, Tempature Chart Page and a user Login Page. 
  
  Create Page - The users can be directed to this page by clicking the "Create Page" button in the navigation bar. Once loaded, users can input a image url of their favorite land rover or star system they find interesting. Then users can input a name for their image, followed-by inputing weather that space rover is currently active or non-active. After clicking submit and going back to the home page, the user will see their newly created rover at the bottom of the page. They can click on it which will show more details.
  
  Tempature on Mars - This displays a chart that outlines the tempature fluxuations on mars within a 7 day period. The "Solar Date" on the x-axis is equal to the earth date in a calander year (solor date 292 = earth day 292 out of 365 days). On the y-axis highlights the tempature in fahrenheit across the 7 day span. The legend points out what the Maximum, Minumum, and Average tempature could be on each day. 
  
  Login - This page uses Json Tokens and Authroization to log the user into their account. This still needed to be fully functional but the styling is accurate to how it would be displayed.
  Background - Our background throughout the site is a video clipped from Youtube, which is pretty cool.
