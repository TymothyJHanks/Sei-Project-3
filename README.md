# MrsRvr Front-End


Description
What your project is (The MrsRvs project is a space exploration inspired web app that implements data from NASA to give the user an out of this world expereince) / should be used for (It should be used for people who want to dive deeper into exploring what the surface looks like on other planets. There is also a chart that outlines the weather patterns on mars.)
What problem(s) your projects solves (The MrsRvr site solves the problem of citizens lacking the knowlege to know whats going beyond earth and is giving them a user-friendly, bite-sized way to gain knowlege about space.)


Brief Example
This could be a code snippet showing how your project should be used (if it is meant to be integrated into another app)
This could be a screenshot of your project running in the browser (if it is a stand-alone application)


List of Features / User Stories
This typically will be a short list of the features / user stories that you planned during the development phase of the project 
To provide more detail, you can show how you categorized these features into Bronze (MVP), Silver, and Gold Levels and indicate which features you complete / have yet to complete
(Our Features Include:
  Home Page - This is the first page that opens up once you go to the site and it displays different pictures that was taken by NASA's land rovers and their satellites. It displays the surfaces of planets but also, images of star systems and galexies. We have a Navigation bar that directs you to our Create Page, Tempature Chart Page and a user Login Page. 
  Create Page - The users can be direected to this page by clicking the "Create Page" button in the navigation bar. Once loaded, users can input 


List of Technologies Used
Often you will want to list the technologies you used to create the project.
This typically would consist of all primary languages, frameworks, and libraries your app is composed of
This is particularly important when it comes to recruiters scanning your projects for keywords


Installation Instructions / Getting Started
This section should walk a reader, step by step, through the process of setting up your project
For a tool meant to be integrated into other projects, this would likely outline the process of installing and accessing this tool in your project
For an application, this would likely outline the process of forking, cloning, and starting the app locally


Contribution Guidelines
This section should offer guidance on where and how users can contribute to your code, identify bugs, and propose improvements
Good links to include are:
A link to the project's main repository
A link to the project's issue tracker
